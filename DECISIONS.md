# Decisions

**Python 3.11.9, not 3.12**
Airflow lags behind the newest Python. Pinned with pyenv local so only
this folder uses it.

**Postgres, not Snowflake**
Free and never expires. A trial account would kill the project in 30 days.

**data/ is gitignored**
Raw files are re-downloadable. Repos should hold code, not data.

**Forced IPv4 in fetch_observations.py**
requests hung forever on NOAA. curl worked. getaddrinfo showed IPv6
addresses listed first — Python tried them and stalled, curl fell back
to IPv4 automatically. Fixed by setting allowed_gai_family to AF_INET.
